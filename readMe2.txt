//Fist Update
//=========== September 20, 2020
1. Coverage
In this materials:
coverage2 refers to breadth-first path generation coverage
coverage3 refers to breadth-first(global) path generation coverage
coverage4 refers to breadth-first(local) path generation coverage
coverage21 refers to uniform coverage path generation coverage

2. Forbidden tuples in input model files
In input model files, the forbidden constraints are forbidden tuples.
For example, p1!=0&&p2!=1 represents the forbidden tuple (p1.0, p2.1).

3. Tool:Stride
Since the algorithms are written without any notations, we are working hard to prepare the tool (Stride) with user-friendly operations now. 
It will take us some time to complete.



//Second Update
//=========== September 20, 2020
We have made the tool Stride more user-friendly now. 
Users may use the tool to reproduce our experiments and generate tests for other systems.
Note that it may still take us some time to make the source code publicly abaliable.
 We are trying our best to provide the best version to you!
